## About structure

### API

#### POST api/generateImage 

###### Parameters
* Request: An instance of the Request object representing the incoming HTTP request.
* Return Value: A promise that resolves to a Response object representing the HTTP response.
* 
#### Function Logic

1. Extracting Request Data 
    - The function retrieves the JSON payload from the incoming request using the request.json() method.
2. Generating NFT Image
    - The extracted data is used to create a prompt for the OpenAI API's images.generate method. 
    - The prompt instructs the AI model (DALL-E 3) to generate an image with specific text content for the question and answer sections of the NFT card.
    - The generated image's URL and filename are extracted from the API response.
3. Error Handling
    - In case of any errors during the OpenAI API request, the function logs an error message to the console.
4. Returning Response
    - The function constructs and returns a JSON response containing the generated NFT image's URL (nftURL) and filename (fileName).

#### Response:
```
{
  "nftURL": "https://example.com/nft-image.jpg",
  "fileName": "nft-image.jpg"
}
```

#### GET api/users 

###### Parameters
* Request: An instance of the Request object representing the incoming HTTP request.
* Return Value: A promise that resolves to a Response object representing the HTTP response.
* 
#### Function Logic

1. Extracting Request Data 
    - The function extracts the wallet parameter from the request URL using the URL class and validates it.
    - If the wallet parameter is an array or not provided, the function returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
2. Handling Respone
    - If the cache contains the name associated with the wallet, the function returns a JSON response with the name; otherwise, it returns a JSON response with the wallet itself.
3. Error Handling
    - In case of any errors during the process, the function logs an error message to the console and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.

#### Response:
```
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

#### POST api/users 

###### Parameters

     - If not, the function returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
3. Caching Data

5. Error Handling
- In case of any errors during the process, the function logs an error message to the console and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.
